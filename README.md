# ðŸ“° Django Blog Site

A simple fully responsive blog platform built with Django, where multiple users can create, edit, and manage their own blog posts. Each blog can include an image, and all posts are visible to all users. It also includes a basic user authentication system â€” users can sign up, log in, and see all blogs or just the ones they've written.
